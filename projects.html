                                           <li> One of the key tasks is to animate the rotation of the wind turbine blades based on the wind speed and direction. This involves calculating and updating the blade angles in real-time to simulate the spinning motion.</li>
                                           <li>The system provides a centralized database to store and manage all the inventory-related information, including product details, stock levels, suppliers, and purchase orders.</li>
                                            <li> This task includes generating random wind speed and direction values, simulating wind gusts or fluctuations, and applying wind forces on the turbine components based on their orientation.</li>
                                            <li> Involves creating an interactive interface that allows users to manipulate these parameters and observe the corresponding effects on the wind turbine's behavior in real-time.</li>
                                              </ul>
