											<h1>Hi, I’m Fariha Iffath<br /> </h1>
											<p>M.Sc at University of Calgary</p>
										</header>
										<p>Welcome to my website! I graduated in November 2024 with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the
<a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/"><span class="label">University of Calgary</span></a>.
Under the guidance of Dr. Marina Gavrilova, my research focused on human aesthetics for biometric identification.
If you're interested in learning more about my research projects, feel free to visit my <a href="research.html">research page</a>.


										</p>
										<p>
											 I am truly passionate about the captivating fields of computer vision, signal processing, natural language processing, deep learning, machine learning, and data analysis. Throughout my journey, I have dedicated a significant portion of my work to leveraging the potential of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks. However, I have also eagerly explored other exciting areas such as security and privacy, natural language processing, signal processing, and advanced data analysis methodologies.

											In my research, I utilize transfer learning models, meta-heuristic feature optimization techniques, deep fusion models, and data-driven insights to address complex challenges effectively.
